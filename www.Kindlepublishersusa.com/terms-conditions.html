                                writers/editors begin work on the project.
                            </p>

                            </p>
                            <p>c) After Project Commencement: Should a refund request be made after the project has
                                started and at least one round of revision has been utilized by the client, a partial
                                refund (up to 5%) may be provided to ensure fair compensation to our internal teams.

                            <p>Customers reserve the right to seek a refund after exploring the specified options if the
                                delivered work does not align with the documented project requirements. We are committed
                                to ensuring 100% customer satisfaction, offering unlimited revisions to guarantee that
                                all deliverables meet expectations. Free pages of equivalent value can be reserved in
                                advance and utilized at any time for added convenience.</p>
                            <ul>

                                <li>Our commitment involves assigning, reassigning, and rewriting work to ensure that
                                    the final delivery meets your expectations. Additionally, customers can reserve free
                                    pages of equivalent value for future use at their discretion. If, despite these
                                    efforts, the delivery still fails to meet your specified requirements, a refund can
                                    be processed. This is contingent upon a mutual agreement on a predetermined
                                    percentage, specifically in instances where the delivery significantly deviates from
                                    the expected standards.
